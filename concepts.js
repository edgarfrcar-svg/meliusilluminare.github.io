The Father is unbegotten; the Son is eternally begotten of the Father; the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son (Filioque), as from one principle. The three Persons are distinguished by relations of origin, not by division of the divine substance.

The Cross is once for all; the Mass applies its fruits. Redemption is objective in Christ and must be subjectively received. Limited-atonement schemes are refused in favor of a universal sufficient cause applied particularly. Anselm’s Cur Deus Homo framed the question in terms of satisfaction: the gravity of sin against an infinite God requires a satisfaction only the God-man can offer. Aquinas integrates satisfaction with the broader economy of the Incarnation, merit, and sacramental application of the fruits of the Passion. The Cross is not a transaction that changes God’s mind from wrath to love; it is the supreme revelation of the love that was always ordered to the salvation of sinners.

Works done in grace are truly meritorious—always as gifts, never as placing God in debt for the first justification. The final judgment according to works is taken at face value as the manifestation and completion of a life of grace, not as a second, independent economy. James 2 and Paul are read together: Abraham was justified by faith, and that faith was completed by works. Trent teaches that works done before justification do not merit justification, while works done in grace increase justification and merit eternal life as a gift promised by God. Faith without works is dead. Charity is the form of the virtues; without it, faith is not living.

The Incarnation is the ground of sacramental realism and of sacred images. The Councils of Nicaea, Ephesus, and Chalcedon define the dogma against Arian, Nestorian, and Monophysite errors. Mary is truly Theotokos, Mother of God, because the One she bore is the divine Person of the Son. Athanasius’s soteriological axiom remains decisive: only if the Son is true God can He deify; only if He is true man can He heal what was fallen.

Conditional baptism is used when previous baptism is doubtful. It is not a second baptism. Baptism may be conferred by immersion, pouring, or sprinkling with the Trinitarian formula. Infants are baptized because they inherit original sin and are capable of receiving grace; the faith of the Church supplies what the infant cannot yet profess.

While Latin theology more often speaks of created grace, Athanasius’s dictum “He was made man that we might be made God” is received in the Catholic tradition as participation by grace, not by identity of essence.
