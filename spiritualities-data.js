    theology: [
      "The goal of asceticism is communion with God, not bodily suffering for its own sake; the body is disciplined so that the whole person may become free for love.",
      "The passions are disordered movements of desire that can enslave the person; purification requires watchfulness, repentance, humility, and grace.",
      "Apatheia means freedom from domination by the passions, not emotional numbness or indifference to persons.",
      "Prayer is the work of the whole person and tends toward purity of heart and continual remembrance of God; psalmody and short prayers train attention.",
      "The struggle with demons is understood spiritually and morally: thoughts, temptations, vainglory, acedia, lust, anger, and despair must be met with discernment rather than fascination.",
      "The Desert Fathers insist on humility, obedience, and discernment because solitary religious intensity without guidance can become pride or spiritual delusion."],

      "The Augustinian path begins inside. God is closer to the soul than the soul is to itself, yet the human heart is disordered by disordered loves. Spiritual life is not first a technique; it is the reordering of desire so that God is loved above all, the self is known in truth, and the neighbor is loved in God. Confession, memory, and the search for rest become the grammar of growth.",
    goal:

      "Grace does not abolish human freedom; it enables a disciplined freedom that can discern among competing goods and choose what most serves God’s purposes.",
      "The Church and the Roman Pontiff have a strong place in Jesuit spirituality, expressed especially through availability for mission and a distinctive vow concerning missions.",
